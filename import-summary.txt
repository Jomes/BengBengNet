ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From LibFramework:
* .gitignore
* LibFramework.iml
* proguard-project.txt
From LibVolley:
* .gitignore
* LibVolley.iml
* LibVolley_fixed.iml
* proguard-project.txt
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In LibVolley:
* AndroidManifest.xml => libVolley/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => libVolley/src/main/res/
* src/ => libVolley/src/main/java/
In LibFramework:
* AndroidManifest.xml => libFramework/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* lint.xml => libFramework/lint.xml
* res/ => libFramework/src/main/res/
* src/ => libFramework/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
